## Data Flow

1. **Client Requests**: Frontend makes API calls through TanStack Query
2. **Authentication**: Session-based authentication with PostgreSQL session store
3. **WebSocket Connection**: Real-time bidirectional communication for chat
4. **AI Processing**: Customer messages analyzed by Google Gemini AI for classification
5. **Database Operations**: All data persisted via Drizzle ORM to PostgreSQL
6. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket events broadcast system changes to connected clients

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: PostgreSQL database connectivity
- **drizzle-orm**: Database ORM and schema management
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Client-side data fetching and caching
- **@google/genai**: Google Gemini AI integration for chat and ticket classification
- **ws**: WebSocket server implementation

### UI Dependencies
- **@radix-ui/***: Accessible UI component primitives
- **tailwindcss**: Utility-first CSS framework

- **date-fns**: Date manipulation utilities

### Development Dependencies
- **vite**: Build tool and development server
- **tsx**: TypeScript execution for Node.js
- **esbuild**: JavaScript bundler for production builds

## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- **Client**: Vite dev server with HMR on port 5173
- **Server**: Express server with tsx for TypeScript execution
- **Database**: Drizzle Kit push for schema changes
- **Environment**: NODE_ENV=development with Replit integration

### Production
- **Build Process**: 
  1. Vite builds client to `dist/public`
  2. esbuild bundles server to `dist/index.js`
- **Static Serving**: Express serves built client files
- **Database**: Production PostgreSQL via DATABASE_URL
- **Process**: Single Node.js process serving both API and static files

### Configuration
- **TypeScript**: Shared configuration across client/server/shared modules
- **Path Aliases**: Configured for clean imports (@/, @shared/)
- **Environment Variables**: DATABASE_URL, GEMINI_API_KEY required
- **Session Storage**: connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL session persistence

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture with emphasis on real-time capabilities, AI integration, and comprehensive monitoring of business system integrations.
